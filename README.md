# loom

This abstraction serves the main purpose: To not think about IO readiness events, but just IO completion.
What do I mean by this? The `io_uring` and `epoll` interface are quite different. `io_uring` takes the SQE,
together with a callback, and the kernel itself will perform the `read` for e.g. `epoll` on the other hand,
only notifies you of the readiness, and you would need to perform the `read` yourself.

This should be abstracted away. The user using this framework should not have to think about IO readiness events,
and the underlying implementation of the asynchronous interface.

## Features

- (Eventually) No runtime allocations
- Intrusive pointers
- Fast context switches (powered by Boost.Context)
- Cross platform: `kqueue`, `epoll`
- Supports unix domain sockets
- Support for pinning event loop to hardware threads.
- `glibc` system call hooks

## Usage

Loom requires that you hook your main method (e.g the same watch Catch2 does) in order to intercept system calls before
`glibc` functions are invoked. This has various purposes, mainly for proper scheduling behaviour and telemetry. For
example, we don't want a `sleep` in the fiber thread to block the entire thread.

> [!info] Note that all macros in `loom` start with `$`.

```cpp
#include <loom/all.hpp>

$LOOM_MAIN(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    // do stuff
    return 0;
}
```

  Talks about the four horsemen of poor performance. Read if necessary
    - Context switches
    - Data copies
    - Lock contention
    - Memoy allocation

*`kqueue`*: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man2/kqueue.2.html

- *`epoll`*: Can add the edge triggered and level triggered stuff also. Since we are using `epoll` and `io_uring`
  and `kqueue`,
  we just make the edge triggered the default.

## Ideas

- [ ] Inject tracy profiling before functions during build step using AST transformations
- [ ] Use `eventfd` for shared mem OB?
